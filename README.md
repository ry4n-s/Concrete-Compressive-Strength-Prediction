# Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction 🏗️🧪📊

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository is dedicated to a machine learning project focused on predicting the compressive strength of concrete. Using a dataset that details the volumes of various ingredients used in concrete mixtures, the project explores how these ingredients affect the final strength of the concrete. The key objective is to build and train a neural network model that can accurately predict the compressive strength based on the composition of the concrete.
